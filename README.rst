   In Work phone the phone extension of the room.
   In the home phone, his personal mobile.
   In the other property, insert the group the user belongs to and who is responsible for him

Then move the home of the user from the default folder to the group folder

    sudo mv /home/*newusername* /home/*[root|gaips]*/

And change it in /etc/passwd:

    *newusername*:x:1000:1000:Some Name,,,:/home/**[root|gaips]**/*newusername*:/bin/bash

(optional) Check if everything is ok at /etc/passwd

    sudo passwd *username*

    Upon UNIX prompt for a new password, enter a new one
    Be sure to confirm by retyping the same new password when prompted again
    Send the new password to the user who requested the password reset
